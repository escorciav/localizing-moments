    "1. Feature description\n",
    "    - RGB and flow features are of size 4096 and 1024, respectively.\n",
    "    - The HDF5 file contains a double tensor of size (6, feat_size)\n",
    "    - TBC: the value on each matrix corresponds to the feature of a 5s chunk.\n",
    "    - Features for each of the 21 possible segments and context features are computed on-the-fly.\n",
    "        - Take a look at L:181:L:197 in file `data_processing.py`\n",
    "            - [URL]()\n",
    "        - Normalization: Frobenius norm of the feature matrix\n",
    "    - Text queries are ...\n",
    "        - There are two features glove matrix and number of words in query.\n",
    "        - Matrix of `[max_len_sentence, num_glove_centroids]`\n",
    "            - Matrix is arrange in a particular way. Order is consistent but short sentences will be padded with a lot of zeros at the begining.\n",
    "        - Number of words is encoded as a vector of size [max_len_sentence]\n",
    "            - This is a binary vector with 1s on the locations where the query has words.\n",
